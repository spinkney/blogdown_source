<p>I recently started using git, github (the online UI counterpart) and bitbucket (at work, similar to github). It’s a powerful tool to organize your work and makes it fairly easy (if opening up the cmd prompt/terminal is your thing) to collaborate with others on coding projects. For true beginners download the free <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"><em>Pro Git</em></a> book and read chapters 1 - 3. It will cover setup, what git is, and almost everything I’m about to say. You can think of the version below as the hyper-abridged version.</p>
<p>After initial set up, noodling around, and creating a few repos/branches, I noticed I kept getting lost in which branch I was on. The “easy” way to save yourself from this is to check where the git HEAD is pointed. That is how git knows where it’s located and why you don’t have to type the name of the branch you’re currently in. Use the command “git log --oneline --decorate”.</p>
<p><img src="/post/img/pointer.png" /> What’s happening in the output? The HEAD is pointed to master. I could change the pointer using <code>git checkout origin/master</code>. The origin/HEAD branch is created from using a remote (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/354312/why-is-origin-head-shown-when-running-git-branch-r">Why is “origin/HEAD” shown when running “git branch -r”?</a>). You’ll be able to figure out 80% of your issues if you know which repo you’re in and whether it’s the local or remote version.</p>

### clone repos from remote ######
##################################

# clone repo to pull into your local directory
git clone URL_EXT_REPO

# clone all repos in project folder
FOR %i in (repo1 repo2 repo3 ...) DO git clone
URL_EXT_REPO/%i

##################################
### clone local repo to remote ###
##################################

# first set up local repo.
# cd into your local repo folder
git init

# clone to remote
git clone URL_EXT_REPO

##################################
### committing and pushing #######
##################################

# let&#39;s start in our local repo
# change something
# added it for &#39;staging&#39;
git add -A  # stages All
git add .   # stages new and modified, without deleted
git add -u  # stages modified and deleted, without new

# commit to local
git commit -m &quot;message&quot;

# push it to remote
git push REMOTENAME BRANCHNAME

# eg git push origin master

##################################
### branching and checkout #######
##################################

# pull the most recent updates first
git pull origin master

# create repo on local
git checkout -b LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME

# create repo on remote
git push origin REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME

# see which branch you&#39;re on
git log --oneline --decorate

# checkout HEAD to branch
git checkout BRANCH_NAME

##################################
### merge with pull-request ######
##################################

# example pull-request demo

# pull the most recent updates first
git pull origin master

# create repo on local
git checkout -b pull-request-demo

# create repo on remote
git push origin pull-request-demo

# change something
git add .
git commit -m &quot;one more update&quot;
git push origin pull-request-demo

# go to online repo and create pull request
# then merge
git pull 
git checkout master
git pull

# delete locally
git branch -d pull-request-demo

# delete remote
git push origin --delete pull-request-demo

##################################
### misc helpful commands ########
##################################

# list remote branches
git branch -r

# rename branch
git branch -m new-name

### forget remote branch ###
git branch -d -r origin/&lt;remote branch name&gt;

# you also need to reset the configuration associated to the local branch:
git config --unset branch.&lt;branch&gt;.remote
git config --unset branch.&lt;branch&gt;.merge

# merge problems?
# resolve conflicts with mergetool
git mergetool</code></pre>
